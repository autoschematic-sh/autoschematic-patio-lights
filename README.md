# autoschematic-patio-lights
In this repo, you can control the lights on https://autoschematic.sh using Autoschematic. 

To get started, clone this repo, cd to it, and install the connector:

`cargo install autoschematic-connector-patio-lights@0.6.1`

Once the patio-lights connector is installed, you can make some changes to `patio/lighting/patio/lights.ron`,
`git add` them, and then run `autoschematic apply` to enact your changes.
